1. This project ,i.e., FileUpload is used to upload files through API's onto user's system

2. The project aims to apply all of my understanding that I have till now about FastAPI and various modules present in python.

3. It includes all the features that previous programs did, in addition to JWT token creations, 
   oauth verification and its application.

4. Through this program, users can upload various file-types like .txt(.md), .pdf , .jpg etc. of upto 5MB of size.

5. Files are stored in the directory specified in the directory as defined in 'UPLOAD_DIR'. Though the program holds the potential to get 
   integrated with cloud services or third-party servers as well.

6. Files are stored in the format(by-name): "filename_time.at.which.they.were.stored" where timezone is UTC.

7. The project can also include features like: Sending e-mail to users about their file-upload, checking for any Malware in the files(Using python AV) etc
